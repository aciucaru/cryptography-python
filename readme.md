# Simple cryptography algorithms in Python

## Vigenere 2D version cipher
This is a matrix (2-dimensional) version of the classic Vigenere cipher.

Both encryption and decryption are made with 2D matrices instead of a regular 1D array of characters (a string).

The user can use regular strings (1-dimensional arrays of characters) for the text and password and the algorithm internally
converts them to 2D matrices of characters. The encryption and decryption is done with matrices only.

## 3DES (triple DES) cipher
This is the triple version of the DES (Data Encryption Standard) cipher from the '70s. The 3DES cipher applies the DES algorithm 3 times, in serires, both for encryption and also for decryption.
